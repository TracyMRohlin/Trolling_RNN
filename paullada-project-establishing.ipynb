    "## Task: Identify personal attacks in Wikipedia comments.\n",
    "[Wikipedia](wikipedia.org), the online encyclopedia, is maintained by a global community of editors. Each page on Wikipedia has an affiliated [talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines), where community members can make suggestions for improvement, record changes they've made, or raise an issue about the page's content. However, the interactions on these talk pages can turn sour. Can we train a classifier to recognize hostility in Wikipedia talk page comments?\n",

    "### Data:\n",
    "[100k labeled comments](https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Talk_Labels_Personal_Attacks/4054689) from English Wikipedia, each labeled by multiple annotators for whether it contains a personal attack.  Labeling is performed by taking the average of the raters' scores and assigning a positive value for any comment with a > 0.5 average.  The attack dataset consists of 102,274 non-attack comments and 13,590 comments rated as attacks; the toxicity dataset contains 15,362 toxic comments and 144,324 non-toxic comments; and the aggression dataset contains 4,991 aggressive comments and 11,0873 non-aggressive comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example benign comment:** \"Thanks man! I will try to improve it.\"  \n",
    "**Example personal attack:** \"shut up mind your own business and go fuck some one else over\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example aggressive comment:** \"I agree, the first one is simply wrong, and the other two are already covered. And I also agree that we have to start getting serious about the math. forumulation\"\n",
    "**Example non-aggressive comment:** \"Yep, that's Twin cities from which this article originated.\"\n"
